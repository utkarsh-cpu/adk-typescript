## Architecture Overview

The TypeScript ADK is designed to provide feature parity with the Python ADK while offering:

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with comprehensive type definitions
- **Mobile Optimization**: React Native-specific optimizations and components
- **Modern APIs**: Async/await patterns and React hooks
- **Cross-Platform**: Support for both iOS and Android through React Native

## Core Concepts

### Agents
Agents are the core building blocks that encapsulate AI behavior and can be composed into complex systems.

### Tools
Tools extend agent capabilities by providing access to external APIs, device features, and custom functionality.

### Models
Model integrations provide access to various LLM providers with a unified interface.

### Flows
Flows manage the conversation and execution patterns between users and agents.
