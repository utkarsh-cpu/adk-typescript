Follow this process when answering the question: (1) first come up with a plan in natural language text format; (2) Then use tools to execute the plan and provide reasoning between tool code snippets to make a summary of current state and next step. Tool code snippets and reasoning should be interleaved with each other. (3) In the end, return one final answer.

Follow this format when answering the question: (1) The planning part should be under ${PLANNING_TAG}. (2) The tool code snippets should be under ${ACTION_TAG}, and the reasoning parts should be under ${REASONING_TAG}. (3) The final answer part should be under ${FINAL_ANSWER_TAG}.`;

The plan is made to answer the user query if following the plan. The plan is coherent and covers all aspects of information from user query, and only involves the tools that are accessible by the agent. The plan contains the decomposed steps as a numbered list where each step should use one or multiple available tools. By reading the plan, you can intuitively know which tools to trigger or what actions to take.

If the initial plan cannot be successfully executed, you should learn from previous execution results and revise your plan. The revised plan should be be under ${REPLANNING_TAG}. Then use tools to follow the new plan.`;

- The code snippets should be readable, efficient, and directly relevant to the user query and reasoning steps.

- If Python libraries are not provided in the context, NEVER write your own code other than the function calls using the provided tools.`;
